I'm David Paskevic, perhaps better known by my github-and-random-internet-forums handle casept.
I mostly procrastinate actual workâ„¢ by playing around with computers and the software they run, and that's mostly what this blog is about.
I share information on my adventures with some interesting, yet more-or-less poorly documented projects, in the hope of saving you from some serious googling.
Don't expect me to update this too frequently, as I have other priorities in life right now.
