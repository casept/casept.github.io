# How to contact me

Github: [@casept](https://github.com/casept)

Email: [davids.paskevics@gmail.com](mailto:davids.paskevics@gmail.com)

Other accounts and current PGP key: [@dpaskevic](https://keybase.io/dpaskevic) on keybase

All previous PGP keys, such as *AF8D B6AF 9C38 4ABC* are artefacts left over on keyservers due to me losing access to the private keys and revocation certs.
Please don't use them to message me, as I'll be unable to decrypt your message.

In general, I prefer not using PGP, as I consider it a pain to use and broken by design.
If you want to message me securely, write me a plaintext E-Mail or get in touch some other way. I'll send you my phone number and we can chat via Signal.
